# RalSWiek Preview Repository
> Release repo for the RalSWiek project

> Current version: pre 0.1.3
---
The RalSWiek project is a roleplay game based on the XNA framework. 
The user takes control over a little man who has to pass his way over some islands.
On this islands there are some strange people living. There is an always drunk wizard and a sometimes struggeling teacher. The wizard holds a quest for you.
You have to start his quest. Otherwise you can't leave the first island.
The second island has a automatic end. You have to reach the third small island on the left and have to walk to the right upper side.

#### Sound bug

To prevent the sound bug please run the OpenAL_Driver_Installer.exe. This will install the OpenAL driver which is needed for the XNA framework to load and play sound files.
The game will run without sounds otherwise.

#### 4K Support

If you use a 4K display create a textfile "4K.txt" in the directory of the game exe. Otherwise the dialogues and inventory overlays will be displayed wrong.
